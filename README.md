## Research  

### Assessing EF2 Tornado Impacts on Vegetation Cover Using Super Dove Satellites  
[View Report](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AmvGoGe3Zb1ngc8gxDpWtGvowZZxmQ)  
- Analyzed the impacts of a July 24, 2022 EF2 tornado in Actinolite, Ontario, across 35.36 km² using NDVI from pre- and post-event satellite imagery.  
- Found a 20.67% reduction in dense vegetation (7.31 km²), providing insight into vegetation loss and environmental recovery through remote sensing.

[View Report](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AmvGoGe3Zb1ngdgZs0WFz-L-cwPLkQ?e=mhYCYN)  
- Expanded tornado damage analysis to 55.78 km² using WFMI and Post-Classification Change Detection techniques.  
- Documented a 9.98% reduction in vegetation cover (5.57 km²), demonstrating the effectiveness of advanced remote sensing methods for disaster impact assessment.  

### Don River Flood Assessment  
[View Report](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AmvGoGe3Zb1nyHx7OhRRmGkRDTYb?e=ht6b83)  
- Conducted a flood risk assessment for the Don River watershed in Toronto, focusing on high-population zones near the river’s outflow.  
- Used DEMs in ArcGIS Pro to simulate water levels (1–5m), identifying risks to up to 1,946 buildings.  
- Findings underscore the importance of preparedness strategies and high-resolution DEM data for urban flood mitigation.
