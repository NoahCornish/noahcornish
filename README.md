## Research

### Assessing EF2 Tornado Impacts On Vegetation Cover Using Super Dove Satellites
  [View Report](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AmvGoGe3Zb1ngc8gxDpWtGvowZZxmQ)

I assessed the impact of an EF2 tornado on vegetation in Actinolite, Ontario, using Super Dove satellites. The tornado struck on July 24, 2022, traveling 56 km eastward from Rockdale and severely affecting a 35.36 km² area. By analyzing satellite imagery from July 11 (before the tornado) and August 12 (after the tornado) using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), I quantified changes in vegetation density. The results revealed a 20.67% loss in dense vegetation (7.31 km²), replaced by sparse vegetation and bare soil. This study highlights the effectiveness of Super Dove satellites in capturing tornado-induced damage and provides valuable insights into vegetation loss and environmental recovery.

I examined vegetation damage caused by the same EF2 tornado over a broader 55.78 km² area. Using Super Dove satellite imagery, I applied advanced techniques such as Write Function Memory Insertion (WFMI) and Post-Classification Change Detections to analyze vegetation changes between July 11 and August 12, 2022. The analysis identified a 9.98% reduction in vegetation cover (5.57 km²). This study further demonstrated the utility of satellite imagery in efficiently detecting tornado impacts, offering a practical methodology for mapping and quantifying vegetation loss in disaster-affected regions.

### Don River Flood Assessment
[View Report](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AmvGoGe3Zb1nyHx7OhRRmGkRDTYb?e=ht6b83)

I conducted a study to assess flood risk in the Don River watershed in Toronto, focusing on the M4M and M5A forward sortation areas from Queen Street East to Lake Ontario. These areas, with 65,767 residents and 5,855 buildings, are particularly vulnerable due to their low elevation near the Don River's outflow. Using data from Land Information Ontario, the City of Toronto Open Data Portal, and Statistics Canada, I analyzed flood scenarios with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in ArcGIS Pro, simulating water levels from 1m to 5m. The results showed that a 1m flood could impact 13 buildings, while a 5m flood could affect up to 1,946 buildings, posing significant risks to infrastructure and residents. This study underscores the critical need for flood preparedness in Toronto and highlights the importance of using high-resolution DEM data for more accurate risk assessments and mitigation planning.
