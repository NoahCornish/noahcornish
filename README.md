## Research

### Assessing EF2 Tornado Impacts On Vegetation Cover Using Super Dove Satellites
  [View Report](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AmvGoGe3Zb1ngc8gxDpWtGvowZZxmQ)

I assessed the impact of an EF2 tornado on vegetation in Actinolite, Ontario, using Super Dove satellites. The tornado struck on July 24, 2022, traveling 56 km eastward from Rockdale and severely affecting a 35.36 km² area. By analyzing satellite imagery from July 11 (before the tornado) and August 12 (after the tornado) using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), I quantified changes in vegetation density. The results revealed a 20.67% loss in dense vegetation (7.31 km²), replaced by sparse vegetation and bare soil. This study highlights the effectiveness of Super Dove satellites in capturing tornado-induced damage and provides valuable insights into vegetation loss and environmental recovery.

I examined vegetation damage caused by the same EF2 tornado over a broader 55.78 km² area. Using Super Dove satellite imagery, I applied advanced techniques such as Write Function Memory Insertion (WFMI) and Post-Classification Change Detections to analyze vegetation changes between July 11 and August 12, 2022. The analysis identified a 9.98% reduction in vegetation cover (5.57 km²). This study further demonstrated the utility of satellite imagery in efficiently detecting tornado impacts, offering a practical methodology for mapping and quantifying vegetation loss in disaster-affected regions.

### Don River Flood Assessment
[View Report](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AmvGoGe3Zb1nyHx7OhRRmGkRDTYb?e=ht6b83)

#### Introduction
This project investigates the flood risk of the Don River in Toronto, focusing on areas from Queen Street East to Lake Ontario. In July 2013, Toronto experienced severe thunderstorms, highlighting the need to assess the vulnerability of urban areas to flooding. This study aims to understand the flood risks in the Don River watershed, specifically within the M4M and M5A forward sortation areas.

#### Study Area
The selected study area is in central Toronto, encompassing the M4M and M5A forward sortation areas, which are prone to flooding due to their low elevation. These areas, with a population of 65,767 and 5,855 buildings, are vital to study as they are located near the outflow of the Don River into Lake Ontario.

#### Methodology
Data for this study was sourced from Land Information Ontario, the City of Toronto Open Data Portal, and Statistics Canada. The study utilized a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to simulate flooding scenarios at different water levels (1m to 5m). Using ArcGIS Pro, the extent of flooding and its impact on buildings and infrastructure were visualized and analyzed.

#### Results & Discussion
Simulations showed that flooding at 1m affects 13 buildings, while a 5m flood could impact up to 1,946 buildings, posing a significant risk to the entire population in the area. The study provides crucial data for the City of Toronto and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority to predict potential damages and improve flood preparedness.

#### Conclusion
The study highlights the severe flood risks posed by the Don River, emphasizing the importance of preparedness and the need for higher resolution DEM data for more accurate modelling.
