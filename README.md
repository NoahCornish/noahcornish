## Research

### Assessing EF2 Tornado Impacts On Vegetation Cover Using Super Dove Satellites
  [View Report](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AmvGoGe3Zb1ngc8gxDpWtGvowZZxmQ)

#### Introduction
The study focuses on assessing the impact of an EF2 tornado on vegetation cover in Actinolite, Ontario, using Super Dove satellites. Tornadoes are a common occurrence in Southern Ontario, particularly during the spring and summer. The EF2 tornado that struck Actinolite on July 24th, 2022, caused significant vegetation damage. The use of Super Dove satellites provides an accurate and efficient method for analyzing tornado damage and improving understanding of the impacts of such events on vegetation.

#### Study Area
The tornado originated in Rockdale, Ontario, and tracked eastward, covering a 56-kilometer path that included Actinolite. The study area, which experienced significant damage, covers 35.36 square kilometers. Satellite imagery from July 11th, 2022 (before the tornado), and August 12th, 2022 (after the tornado), was used to visualize the affected region.

#### Methodology
The study utilized Super Dove (PSB.SD) satellite imagery, which offers a spatial resolution of 3 meters per pixel across eight spectral bands. For this analysis, four specific spectral bands were selected: Blue, Green I, Red, and Near-infrared (NIR). The methodology involved calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to assess changes in vegetation before and after the tornado. NDVI values were classified into different ranges to quantify vegetation cover, from sparse to dense.

#### Results & Discussion
The NDVI analysis revealed a significant drop in dense vegetation (NDVI: 0.6-0.8), with a decrease of 7.31 square kilometers, representing a 20.67% loss. This loss corresponded to an increase in sparse vegetation and bare soil. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of satellite imagery and NDVI in quantifying tornado impacts on vegetation cover, highlighting the shift from dense to sparse vegetation following the tornado.

#### Conclusion
The study concludes that Super Dove satellites are effective tools for assessing tornado damage to vegetation. The EF2 tornado in Actinolite resulted in a substantial reduction in dense vegetation, providing valuable insights into the extent of tornado impacts. This approach could be useful for future assessments of tornado effects on vegetation cover.

### Assessing EF2 Tornado Impacts on Vegetation Cover In Actinolite, Ontario, Using Super Dove Satellites
  [View Report](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AmvGoGe3Zb1ngdgZs0WFz-L-cwPLkQ?e=mhYCYN)

#### Introduction
The study investigates the impact of an EF2 tornado on vegetation cover in Actinolite, Ontario, using Super Dove satellites. The tornado struck on July 24th, 2022, causing significant damage. This research aims to efficiently assess the extent of vegetation damage caused by the tornado using satellite imagery.

#### Study Area
The EF2 tornado originated in Rockdale, Ontario, and traveled east to Actinolite, covering a 56-kilometer path. The tornado caused extensive vegetation damage, particularly in and around Actinolite. The study area spans 55.78 square kilometers, with satellite imagery collected before and after the event (July 11th and August 12th, 2022).

#### Methodology
Satellite imagery from Planet Labs' Super Dove satellite was used to analyze the tornado's impact. The images were radiometrically and geometrically corrected using the Top of Atmosphere Radiance (TOAR) formula. Four spectral bands (Blue, Green I, Red, and Near-infrared) were selected for the analysis. Techniques such as Write Function Memory Insertion (WFMI) and Post-Classification Change Detections were employed to assess vegetation changes between the two dates.

#### Results & Discussion
The analysis revealed a 9.98% reduction in vegetation cover within the study area, translating to 5.57 square kilometers of damage. The WFMI and Post-Classification Change Detections highlighted areas with significant vegetation loss and provided statistical data on the classification changes. The findings confirm the effectiveness of Super Dove satellites in detecting and quantifying tornado-induced vegetation damage.

#### Conclusion
The study successfully demonstrates the application of remote sensing technology for assessing tornado damage on vegetation. The results show that the tornado caused significant vegetation loss, and the methodology used can be useful for future assessments of tornado impacts on vegetation cover.

### Don River Flood Assessment
[View Report](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AmvGoGe3Zb1nyHx7OhRRmGkRDTYb?e=ht6b83)

#### Introduction
This project investigates the flood risk of the Don River in Toronto, focusing on areas from Queen Street East to Lake Ontario. In July 2013, Toronto experienced severe thunderstorms, highlighting the need to assess the vulnerability of urban areas to flooding. This study aims to understand the flood risks in the Don River watershed, specifically within the M4M and M5A forward sortation areas.

#### Study Area
The selected study area is in central Toronto, encompassing the M4M and M5A forward sortation areas, which are prone to flooding due to their low elevation. These areas, with a population of 65,767 and 5,855 buildings, are vital to study as they are located near the outflow of the Don River into Lake Ontario.

#### Methodology
Data for this study was sourced from Land Information Ontario, the City of Toronto Open Data Portal, and Statistics Canada. The study utilized a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to simulate flooding scenarios at different water levels (1m to 5m). Using ArcGIS Pro, the extent of flooding and its impact on buildings and infrastructure were visualized and analyzed.

#### Results & Discussion
Simulations showed that flooding at 1m affects 13 buildings, while a 5m flood could impact up to 1,946 buildings, posing a significant risk to the entire population in the area. The study provides crucial data for the City of Toronto and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority to predict potential damages and improve flood preparedness.

#### Conclusion
The study highlights the severe flood risks posed by the Don River, emphasizing the importance of preparedness and the need for higher resolution DEM data for more accurate modelling.
