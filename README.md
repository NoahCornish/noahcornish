# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Noah Cornish! I am currently enrolled in my first year of the Bachelor of Education (BEd) I/S stream at Nipissing University. I graduated in June of 2023 with my Honours Specialization in Enviornmental Geography with two specialists in Geomatics and Environmental Mangement with a minor in Biology.

I am currently working on various hockey projects. I have created a R Package to access Ontario Hockey League (OHL) data. You can check it out here (https://github.com/NoahCornish/OHLpkg)!
